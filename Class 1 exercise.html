  <p>This is a webpage that I build from scratch. I built it with my two hands. I wrote all the introductory code and supporting code and now I know how to make it look pretty!</p>
  <p>What an exciting time this is! This is only the beginning of many many websites and tons of projects that will showcase everything that I've learnt here at Lighthouse Labs. It's the start of somethig very exciting.</p>
