  <p>This is a webpage that I build from <strong>scratch</strong>. I built it with my two hands. I wrote all the introductory code and supporting code and now I know how to make it look <strong>pretty!</strong></p>
  <p><span>What an exciting time this is!</span>This is only the <em>beginning</em> of many many websites and tons of projects that will showcase <em>everything</em> that I've learnt here at Lighthouse Labs. It's the start of somethig very exciting.</p>
